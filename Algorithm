Initialize three semaphores, one for each ingredient (tobacco, paper, matches), with an initial value of 0.

Initialize a semaphore for the table, with an initial value of 1 (to represent that the table is initially empty).

Create three producer threads, each responsible for producing two of the three ingredients required for smoking.
Each producer thread runs an infinite loop:
Wait on the two semaphores corresponding to the ingredients it produces 
(e.g. the producer thread responsible for tobacco and paper waits on the tobacco and paper semaphores).
Acquire the table semaphore.
Put the two ingredients on the table.
Release the table semaphore.

Create a smoker thread for each ingredient. Each smoker thread runs an infinite loop:
Wait on the semaphore corresponding to its missing ingredient (e.g. the smoker thread waiting for matches waits on the matches semaphore).
Acquire the table semaphore.
Take the two ingredients it needs from the table.
Release the table semaphore.
Smoke the cigarette.
Signal the semaphore corresponding to the ingredient it just used (e.g. the smoker thread that used matches signals the matches semaphore).

Start all threads.
